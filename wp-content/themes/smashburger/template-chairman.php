				<p class="white-text">Additionally in 2011, Rick launched the USA Pro Challenge, a professional cycling event that has engaged more than a million in-person spectators and numerous additional fans. The event which returns in August 2013, features an intense course at an altitude greater than 12,000 feet through the challenges of Colorado’s Rocky Mountain terrain. In 2013, the multiple-day race travelled through Aspen, Breckenridge, Steamboat Springs, and other locations known for their dramatic beauty. Widely known as “America’s Race,” the USA Pro Challenge partners with corporations and brands such as The Coca-Cola Company, UnitedHealthcare, Nissan, and The Denver Post.  He developed the event in part as a means of showcasing Colorado as the heart of professional bicycle racing in the United States.</p>
